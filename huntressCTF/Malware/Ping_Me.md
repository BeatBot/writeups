### Challenge description

We found this file in the autoruns of a host that seemed to have a lot of network activity... can you figure out what it was doing? 

### Solution

Its a `vbs` script, we change the first part to `WScript.Echo` instead of `Execute` so it doesnt run and run it using:

```cmd
cscript.exe .\ping_me.vbs
```
We get:

```
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.812
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Dim sh, ips, i:Set sh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell"):ips = Array("102.108.97.103", "123.54.100.49", "98.54.48.52", "98.98.49.98", "54.100.97.51", "50.98.56.98", "98.99.97.57", "101.50.54.100", "53.49.53.56", "57.125.35.35"):For i = 0 To UBound(ips):    sh.Run "cmd /Q /c ping " & ips(i), 0, False:Next
```

Grabbing the ips and using `From decimal` in CyberChef we get the flag.
