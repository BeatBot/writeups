### Challenge description

Our team of security analysts recently worked through a peculiar Lumma sample.
The dentists helping us advised we floss at least twice a day to help out.
He also gave us this weird file. Maybe you can help us out.

### Solution

Reversing with ghidra we see that it is xoring something. After quite some time, my team member `isDaDev` sovled it with a python script.

```python
# Byte arrays from GDB
pbVar7 = [
    0x53, 0x51, 0x51, 0x55, 0x52, 0x5e, 0x56, 0x07,
    0x01, 0x04, 0x0d, 0x02, 0x00, 0x03, 0x56, 0x5b,
    0x0f, 0x50, 0x07, 0x01, 0x53, 0x50, 0x0b, 0x50,
    0x55, 0x00, 0x51, 0x5b, 0x01, 0x06, 0x53, 0x06
]

pbVar8 = [
    0x31, 0x65, 0x63, 0x66, 0x66, 0x38, 0x62, 0x65,
    0x63, 0x65, 0x39, 0x34, 0x38, 0x36, 0x32, 0x38,
    0x37, 0x64, 0x63, 0x37, 0x36, 0x35, 0x32, 0x31,
    0x61, 0x38, 0x34, 0x62, 0x62, 0x37, 0x63, 0x30
]

# Result array
result = []

for i in range(32):
    result.append(pbVar7[i] ^ pbVar8[i])

# Convert result to characters
flag_chars = [chr(r) for r in result]
flag = ''.join(flag_chars)

# Add flag prefix and suffix
full_flag = 'flag{' + flag + '}'
print(full_flag)
```
flag{b4234f4bba4685dc84d6ee9a48e9c106}
