### Challenge description

An adventurer is YOU! Play Knight's Quest, beat the three monsters, and claim the flag! Very straightforward with no surprises, no sir-ee, no surprises here lmao 

### Solution

Altho its a rev. challenge i went a different route. After messing around with it for a bit, i thought to use `Cheat Engine` to solve this, well, game. It worked!

I had to scan for my health and lock it while finding bosses health and attack and lowering them to `5` so i can strike him with 1 hit and it worked!
