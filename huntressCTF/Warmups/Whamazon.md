### Challenge description

Wham! Bam! Amazon is entering the hacking business! Can you buy a flag?

### Solution

We start the instance and check the page. We have options to check inventory, to buy something and to exit.

Lets go and buy something. Oh, we only have `$50`. Can we buy `-1` apples? Yes! Now we have `$53` because one apple costs `$3`. So lets buy `-1000000000` apples.

Cool, now we have `$3000000053`. Let's buy the flag! It wants us to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.. okey.

We won and got the flag. Go back and check the inventory.
