### Challenge description

Thanks for joining the help desk! Here's your first ticket of the day; can you help the client out?

NOTE, this challenge uses a non-standard flag format. Enter the human-readable name of the location.

### Solution

It's and email file that we can analyze. I uploaded the file to [this](https://eml-analyzer.herokuapp.com/) website and downloaded the images.

Ran `exiftool`, reverse searched the image, nothing. Started searching for the string on the plaque and with a bit of trial and error, we got the flag.
